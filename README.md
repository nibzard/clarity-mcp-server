Click the first button to install the Microsoft Clarity MCP server directly in Visual Studio Code.
Click the second button to install it with a prompt for your Clarity API token, which VS Code asks for when the server starts for the first time.

If you used the first button, set the token in your environment before starting the server:

**macOS/Linux (current terminal session):**

```bash
export CLARITY_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

**Windows (permanent; restart your terminal and VS Code after running):**

```powershell
setx CLARITY_API_TOKEN "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

#### Claude Desktop Plugin

Install from Claude's extension gallery:

1. Open **Claude Desktop**
2. Navigate to **File → Settings → Extensions**
3. Search for **Microsoft Clarity**
4. Click **Install** to add the extension
5. Configure your **API Token**:
   <br>
   Follow the instructions in the [API Token section](#api-token) to retrieve and set it up correctly.

## Configuration

You can provide the [Clarity data export API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/setup-and-installation/clarity-data-export-api) token in two ways:

1. **Command Line Arguments**:
   ```bash
   npx @microsoft/clarity-mcp-server --clarity_api_token=your-token
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   <br>
   Set `CLARITY_API_TOKEN` in the environment of the server process:
   ```bash
   export CLARITY_API_TOKEN=your-token
   ```

## Configuring MCP Clients

### Generic MCP Client Configuration

MCP clients typically require configuration to connect to the server. Here's a general example of how to configure an MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@microsoft/clarity-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@microsoft/clarity-mcp-server",
        "--clarity_api_token=your-api-token-here"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The specifics of where and how to add this configuration will depend on your specific MCP client.

### Claude for Desktop Configuration

1. Open your Claude for Desktop configuration file:
   - **Windows**: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Add the configuration shown in the generic example above
3. Save the configuration file and restart Claude for Desktop

### GitHub Copilot CLI Configuration
